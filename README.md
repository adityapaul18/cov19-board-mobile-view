While the pandemic was going on, every dashboard of covid 19 that I checked showed a lot of unrequired info in which I had to find out the stats of required state and districts. I was learning Web-Dev at that time so I decided to create my own dashboard to test my application skills. This dashboard shows precise data of global, Indian and my district's confirmed , active ,recovered and deaths cases. It has minimal yet fine-tuned UI. I have open sourced it's code on github for others to add features or to see the components that I used .You can access that on the GITHUB link in the side-menu .
Stay safe, wear a mask
